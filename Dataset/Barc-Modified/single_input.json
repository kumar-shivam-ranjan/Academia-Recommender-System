    "title": "Bottleneck Routing Games in Communication Networks",
    "abstract": "We  consider  routing  games  where  the  performance  of each  user  is  dictated  by  the  worst (bottleneck)  element it employs. We  are  given  a  network,  finitely  many  (selfish)  users,  each associated  with  a  positive  flow  demand,  and  a  load-dependent performance  function  for  each  network  element;  the  social  (i.e., system)  objective  is  to  optimize  the  performance  of  the  worst element  in the network (i.e., the network bottleneck).  Although we show  that such  bottleneck  routing games appear in  a  variety of practical scenarios, they have not been considered yet. Accordingly, we  study  their  properties,  considering  two  routing  scenarios, namely  when  a  user  can  split  its  traffic  over  more  than  one  path (splittable  bottleneck  game)  and  when  it  cannot  (unsplittable bottleneck  game).    First,  we  prove  that,  for  both  splittable  and unsplittable  bottleneck  games,  there  is  a  (not  necessarily  unique) Nash  equilibrium. Then,  we consider  the rate of  convergence to  a Nash  equilibrium  in  each  game.  Finally,  we  investigate  the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in both games with respect  to the social optimum; specifically, while for both games we show that the price  of  anarchy  is  unbounded,  we  identify  for  each  game conditions under which Nash equilibria are socially optimal."
